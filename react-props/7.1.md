# What Are Component Props?

The simplest way to explain component props would be to say that they function similar to HTML attributes. For example, in the code below a `Badge` component is created and it is expecting a 'name' prop to be sent when the component is instantiated.

Inside the render function of the `BadgeList` component, where `Badge` is used, the `name` prop is added to the `Badge` component much like an HTML attribute is added to an HTML element (i.e., `<Badge name="Bill" />`). The `name` prop is then used by the `Badge` component (i.e., `this.props.name`) as the text node for the React `<div>` node rendered by the Badge component.

Another way to think about component props is that they are the configuration values sent to a component. If you look at the non-JSX version of the previous code example it should be obvious component props are just an object that gets passed to the     `createElement()` function (i.e., `React.createElement(Badge, { name: "Bill" })`).

```
var Badge = React.createClass({
	displayName: "Badge",

	render: function render() {
		return React.createElement(
			"div",
			null, //no props defined, so null
			this.props.name //use passed this.prop.name as text node
		);
	}
});

var BadgeList = React.createClass({
	displayName: "BadgeList",

	render: function render() {
		return React.createElement(
			"div",
			null,
			React.createElement(Badge, { name: "Bill" }),
			React.createElement(Badge, { name: "Tom" })
		);
	}
});

ReactDOM.render(React.createElement(BadgeList, null), document.getElementById('app'));
```

This is similar to how props can be set directly on React nodes (see 4.4 and 5.7). However, when the `createElement()` function is passed a component definition (i.e., `Badge`) instead of a node, the props become available on the component itself (i.e., `this.props.name`). Component props make it possible to re-use the Badge component with any name.

In the code example examined in this section the `BadgeList` component uses two `Badge` components each with there own `this.props` object. We can verify this by console logging out the value of `this.props` when a `Badge` component is instantiated.

Basically every React component has a unique instance property call `props` that starts as an empty JavaScript object. The empty object can get filled with any JavaScript values that an object can hold.
