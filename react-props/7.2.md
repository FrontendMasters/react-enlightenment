# Sending Component Props

Sending properties to a component entails adding HTML attribute like named values to the component when it is used, not when it is defined. For example, the below `Badge` component is defined first. Then, to send a prop to the `Badge` component, `name="Bill"` is added to the component when it is used (i.e., when `<Badge name="Bill" />` is rendered).

```
var Badge = React.createClass({
	render: function() {
		return <div>{this.props.name}</div>;
	}
});

ReactDOM.render(<Badge name="Bill" />, document.getElementById('app'));
```

Keep in mind anywhere a component is used a property can be sent to it. For example, the code from the previous section demonstrates the use of the `Badge` component and `name` property from within the `BadgeList` component.

```
var Badge = React.createClass({
	render: function() {
		return <div>{this.props.name}</div>;
	}
});

var BadgeList = React.createClass({
	render: function() {
		return (<div>
			<Badge name="Bill" />
			<Badge name="Tom" />
		</div>);
	}
});

ReactDOM.render(<BadgeList />, document.getElementById('app'));
```

#### Notes

* A components properties should be considered immutable and components should not internally alter the properties sent to them from above. If you need to alter the properties of a component then a re-render should occur; don't set props by adding/updating them using `this.props.[PROP] = [NEW PROP]`.
