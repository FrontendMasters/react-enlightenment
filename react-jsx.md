# JavaScript Syntax Extension (aka JSX)

In the previous chapter we learned how to create React nodes using plain ES5 JavaScript code. In this Chapter we look at creating React nodes using the JSX syntax extension.

After this Chapter JSX will be used for the remainder of this book unless invoking a `React.createElement()` function is required for the sake of clarity.
