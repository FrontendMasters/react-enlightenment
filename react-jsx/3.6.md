 # Using Inline CSS in JSX

In order to define inline styles on React nodes you need to pass the `style` prop/attribute a JavaScript object or reference to an object containing CSS properties and values.

In the code below I first setup a JavaScript object, named `styles`, containing inline styles. Then I use the `{ }` brackets to reference the object that should be used for the value of the style prop/attribute (e.g., `style={styles}`).

Notice that, the CSS properties are in a camelCased form similar to what is used when writing [CSS properties in JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Properties_Reference). This is required because JavaScript does not allow hyphens in names.

When the above React/JSX code is transformed by Babel, and then parsed by a JavaScript engine, the resulting HTML will be:

```html
<div style="color:red;background-color:black;font-weight:bold;" data-reactid=".0">test</div>
```

#### Notes

* Vendor prefixes other than ms should begin with a capital letter. This is why WebkitTransition has an uppercase "W".
* CamelCased CSS properties shouldn't be a suprise given this is how it is done when accessing properties on DOM nodes from JS (e.g., `document.body.style.backgroundImage`)
* When specifying a pixel value React will automatically append the string "px" for you after your number value except for the following properties:

```html
columnCount fillOpacity flex flexGrow flexShrink fontWeight lineClamp lineHeight
opacity order orphans strokeOpacity widows zIndex zoom
```
