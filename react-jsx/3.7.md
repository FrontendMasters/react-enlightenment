# Defining Attributes/Props in JSX

In the previous chapter, section X.X, I discussed passing `React.createElement(type, props, children)` attributes/props when defining React nodes. Since JSX is transformed into `React.createElement()` function calls you basically already have a understanding of how React node attributes/props work. However, since JSX is used to express XML-like nodes that get turned into HTML, attribute/props are defined by adding the attributes/props to JSX expressions as name-value attributes. If it helps, attributes/props are to React nodes what arguments are to functions.

In the code example below I am defining a React `<li>` element node, using JSX, with five attributes/props. One is a non-standard HTML attribute (e.g., `foo:'bar'`) and the others are known HTML attributes.

```js
var styles = {backgroundColor:'red'};
var tested = true;
var text = 'text';

var reactNodeLi = <li id=""
                      data-test={tested?'test':'false'}
                      className="blue"
                      aria-test="test"
                      style={styles}
                      foo="bar">
                          {text}
                  </li>;

ReactDOM.render(reactNodeLi, document.getElementById('app1'));
```
The JSX when it is transformed will look like this (note that attributes/props just become arguments to a function):

```
var reactNodeLi = React.createElement(
    'li',
    { id: '',
        'data-test': tested ? 'test' : 'false',
        className: 'blue',
        'aria-test': 'test',
        style: styles,
        foo: 'bar' },
    text
);
```
When the `reactNodeLi` node is render to the DOM it will look like this:

```HTML
<div id="app1">
    <li id="true"
        data-test="test"
        class="blue"
        aria-test="test"
        style="background-color:red;"
        data-reactid=".0">
            text
    </li>
</div>
```

You should note the following four things:

1. Leaving an attribute/prop blank results in that attribute value becoming true (e.g., `id=""` becomes `id="true"` and `test` becomes `test="true"`)
2. The `foo` attribute, because it was not a standard HTML attribute does become a final HTML attribute, but it is still available (i.e., `this.props.foo`)
3. You can't write inlines styles in JSX. You have to reference an object in scope that contains CSS properties (written as JS properties).
4. Any JavaScript values can be injected into JSX using `{}` (e.g., `test={text}` and `data-test={tested?'test':'false'}`).

#### Notes

* If an attribute/prop is duplicated the last one defined wins.
* If you pass props/attributes to native HTML elements that do not exist in the HTML specification, React will not render them. However, if you use a custom element (i.e., not a standard HTML element) then arbitrary/custom attributes will be added to custom elements (e.g., `<x-my-component custom-attribute="foo" />`).
* Omitting the value of an attribute/prop causes JSX to treat it as true (i.e., `<input checked id type="checkbox" />` becomes `<input checked="true" id="true" type="checkbox">`). This will even occur for attributes/props that are not presented in the final HTML due to the fact they are not actual HTML attributes.
* The `class` attribute has to be written `className`
* The `for` attribute has to be written `htmlFor`
* The `style` attribute takes a reference to an object of [camel-cased style properties](https://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Style/css.html#CSS-CSS2Properties)
* HTML form elements (e.g., `<input></input>`, `<textarea></textarea>`, etc.) created [as React nodes](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/forms.html) support a few attributes/props that are affected by user interaction. These are: `value`, `checked`, and `selected`.
* React offers the [`key`](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/multiple-components.html#dynamic-children), [`ref`](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/more-about-refs.html), and [`dangerouslySetInnerHTML`](https://facebook.github.io/react/tips/dangerously-set-inner-html.html) attributes/props that don't exist in DOM and take on a unique role/function.
* All attributes are camel-cased (e.g., `accept-charset` is written as `acceptCharset`) which differs from how they are written in HTML.
* The following are the HTML attributes that React supports (shown in camel-case):

```HTML
accept acceptCharset accessKey action allowFullScreen allowTransparency alt
async autoComplete autoFocus autoPlay capture cellPadding cellSpacing challenge
charSet checked classID className colSpan cols content contentEditable

```

* The following are the SVG attributes that React supports (shown in camel-case):

```svg
