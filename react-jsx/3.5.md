# Using JavaScript Comments in JSX

You can place JavaScript comments anywhere in React/JSX you want except locations where JSX might expect a React child node. In this situation you'll have to escape the comment using `{ }` so that JSX knows to pass that on as actual JavaScript.

Examine the code below, make sure you understand where you'll have to tell JSX to pass along a JS comment so a child React node is not created.

```js
var reactNode = <div /*comment*/>{/* use {} here to comment*/}</div>;
```

In the above code if I had not wrapped the comment inside of the `<div>` with `{ }` brackets then Babel would have converted the comment to a React text node. The outcome, unintentionally, without the `{ }` would be:

```js
var reactNode = React.createElement(
  "div",
  null,
  "/* use ",
  " here to comment*/" 
);
```

Which would result in the following HTML that would have unintended text nodes.

```html
<div data-reactid=".0">
    <span data-reactid=".0.0">/* use </span><span data-reactid=".0.1"> here to comment*/</span>
</div>
```
