# Creating React nodes with JSX

Working off the knowledge given in the previous chapter you should be familiar with creating React nodes using the `React.createElement()` function. For example, using this function one can create React nodes which both represent  HTML DOM nodes and custom HTML DOM nodes. Below I use this familiar function to create two React nodes. 

```js
//React node, which represents an actual HTML DOM node
var HTMLLi = React.createElement('li', {className:'bar'}, 'foo');

//React node, which represents a custom HTML DOM node
var HTMLCustom = React.createElement('foo-bar', {className:'bar'}, 'foo');
```

To use JSX instead of `React.createElement()` to create these React nodes one just has to replace `React.createElement()` function calls with the HTML/XML like tags which represent the HTML you'd like the virtual DOM to spit out. The above code can be written in JSX like so.

```js
//React node, which represents an actual HTML DOM node
var HTMLLi = <li className="bar">foo</li>;

//React node, which represents a custom HTML DOM node
var HTMLCustom = <foo-bar className="bar" >foo</foo-bar>;
```

Notice that the JSX is not in a string format and can just be writing as if you are writing it inside of an `.html` file. As stated many times already JSX is then transformed back into the `React.createElement()` functions calls by Babel. You can see the transformation occurring in the following JSFiddle.

[source code](https://jsfiddle.net/wc6dtkov/#tabs=js,result,html,resources)

If you were to examine the actual HTML produced in the above JSfiddle it would look like so:

```html
<body>
    <div id="app1"><li class="bar" data-reactid=".0">foo</li></div>
    <div id="app2"><foo-bar class="bar" data-reactid=".1">foo</foo-bar></div>
</body>
```

#### Notes

* JSX tags support the XML self close syntax so you can optionally leave the closing tag off when no child node is used.
* If you pass props/attributes to native HTML elements that do not exist in the HTML specification, React will not render them to the actual DOM. However, if you use a custom element (i.e. not a stand HTML element) then arbitrary/custom attributes will be added to custom elements (e.g. `<x-my-component custom-attribute="foo" />`).
* The `class` attribute has to be written `className`
* The `for` attribute has to be written `htmlFor`
* The `style` attribute takes an object of [camel-cased style properties](https://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Style/css.html#CSS-CSS2Properties)
* All attributes are camel-cased (e.g. `accept-charset` is written as `acceptCharset`)
* The following are the HTML attributes that React supports (shown in camel-case):

```HTML
