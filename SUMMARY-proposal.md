0. Getting React Setup

* Why is this complicated?
* React & Babel, thus React & ES*
* Option 1. No JSX
* Editor Setup
* Option 2. JSX in the browser
* Option 3. JSX compiling in dev

1 React Overview

* React namespace
* React.createClass (define react component using JSX)
* React.createElement (create react elements, i.e., DOM)
* ReactDOM.render (place react elements into actual DOM via virtual DOM)
* Using {} in JSX
* Props (how data is passed down the tree via attributes and child nodes)

2. React Ideas/Concepts

* Custom elements
* Composable Components / tree of components / component hierarchy
* Controller components, i.e., top-level branch components
* JSX (an XML-ish like HTML written in JS)
* Virtual DOM
* React is safe. We are not generating HTML strings so XSS protection is the default.
* Separate rendering options of which DOM is one
* No templates, just JSX
* Use JavasScript
* Immutable props
* Mutable state
* Reactivity via state
* build a static version first, then at interactivity
* stateless v.s stateful components

3. React Conventions

* Note that native HTML element names start with a lowercase letter, while custom React class names begin with an uppercase letter.
