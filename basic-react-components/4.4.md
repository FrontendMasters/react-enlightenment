This is typically referred to as a stateless function component.

Stateless function components can't be passed component options (i.e., `render`, `componentWillUnmount`, etc.). However `.propTypes` and `.defaultProps` can be set as properties on the function.

The code example below demonstrates a stateless function component making use of `.propTypes` and `.defaultProps`.
